sgviewer Build 100


Overview
--------

sgviewer is a real-time renderer of .sg 3D scene files.


Install
-------

Just copy the files in this package to some empty directory, 
for example c:\sgviewer, and start the application.
ALT+F4 quits. Now you can view sg files by double-clicking them.


Configuration
-------------

Rendering options can be changed from text file sgviewer.prop.
sgviewer.prop is in the same directory as sgviewer.exe.
Properties can be reset by deleting the file -- when you
next time start the sgviewer, a new property file is created.
Property file location is updated by starting the viewer without 
document.

Settings in sgviewer.prop:
Back                Back plane distance (or 0 if automatic)
BitsPerPixel        Bit depth of the rendering window (or 0 for desktop mode)
Front               Front plane distance (or 0 if automatic)
HWTnL               Use hardware T&L
Height              Height of the rendering window
MaxDebugLines       Maximum number of debug lines to draw in one frame
MovementSpeed<X>    Movement speed (km/h) when key <X> is pressed
Profiling           Toggle code profiling statistics on/off
RefRasterizer       Use software reference rasterizer
Refresh             Refresh rate in Hz (fullscreen modes only)
RotationSpeed<X>    Rotation speed (deg/s) when key <X> is pressed
Statistics          Toggle statistics (0==off, 1==on)
StencilEnabled      Stencil buffer toggle (0==off, 1==on)
Width               Width of the rendering window


Shadows
-------

If a scene contains directional light named 'keylight',
then shadows are added to the scene.


Material Name Tags
------------------

(note: case-sensitive, as everything else)

SORT                enable sorting for this material


Statistics
----------

By pressing T you can toggle statistics display. Statistics can slow
down rendering a bit.

Displayed statistics:
front/back          Camera front / back plane distance
shadow tri          Number of shadow triangles rendered
tri                 Total number of triangles rendered / in scene
obj X / Y           Number of objects rendered / processed
lts X               Number of lights rendered
pri X               Number of primitives (triangle batches) rendered
tri X               Number of triangles rendered
fps X               Frames per second
