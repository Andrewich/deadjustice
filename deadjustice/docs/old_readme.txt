Copyright (C) 2003 Cat Mother Ltd.

THIS IS A VERY EARLY PROTOTYPE DEMO VERSION OF DEAD JUSTICE GAME


First, a few important notes about Dead Justice playable prototype demo
running on PC platform:

- This PC demo tries to emulate visually Xbox on pc and supports PS2 dualshock
  controller via EMS2 adapter to provide console style controls.

- Demo has been tested to run on GeForce3, GeForce4 and ATI Radeon 9700 Pro
  with latest NVidia/ATI reference display drivers (April 9, 2003).
  If you encounter problems with these cards make sure you have the latest
  display drivers installed.
  GeForce MX/Go cards are not supported as they are not equipped with pixel 
  shader support.

********************************************************************************
- Demo currently requires a display card with pixel shader support.
- Microsoft DirectX 9 run time needs to be installed.
  (can be downloaded from www.microsoft.com/directx)
********************************************************************************

What will be different in final version of game?

- PC version of the game will look almost identical to Xbox version with display
cards that support pixel shaders.

- Legacy shading mode will be implemented into PC version of the game to support
older display cards.

- PS2 version will differ bit more from previous two visually, but it will be
more closer to legacy shading mode of PC game.

Gameplay Features


Basic Player Movement
---------------------

 Harley can sneak, walk and run with seamless analog speed control if you're
using a PS2 controller. You can move to all directions, without limits.
Only limitation is that you cannot run or walk so fast backwards.
This means that you can move sideways, diagonal directions etc.

 Analog control is simulated on keyboard with modifier keys to alter movement
speed. Movement speed is essential to avoid certain enemies / assault them
by suprise.


Turning and Aiming
------------------

 When you move mouse / use left thumb stick with a PS2 controller, you can move
your aim freely - Where the crosshair points, Harley aims.

 When you move crosshair enough off-center, Harley starts to turn. The more you
move crosshair off-center, Harley will turn more quickly.
 
 When you return crosshair to roughly center, Harley stops turning. This method
provides very easy and smooth 1st person-like control and freedom.


Shooting and Reloading
----------------------

 Harley can raise weapon to shooting position when you're certain that you'll
meet resistance in next few seconds - This way you save a few precicious
seconds. Just click fire button once and Harley raises weapon to shooting
position.

 Harley can reload your weapon whenever you want. This way you have control of
the amount of ammo you have when you jump out of cover and fire at enemies.

You can cancel reloading of weapon if you're in desperate situation and need to
run for cover. You can do this automaticly by rolling to any of directions
possible.


Peeking Behind Corners
----------------------

 You can assault enemies more safely if you use peek mode - Harley can quickly
"peek" around a corner by hopping to a wide, low stance to 2m sideways
location, left or right. You can aim fire freely in peek mode too. When you
release peek button, Harley returns behind corner.


Crouched Movement
-----------------

 Harley can crouch to take cover behind boxes, fences and so on.

 Harley can also move in crouched position. This might sometimes give you bit
more protection if you need to move when enemies are shooting at you and
you're moving behind medium height objects.


Rolling
-------

 Harley can roll forwards, backwards and sideways on ground in case you need to
take cover quickly / avoid enemy fire if you're taken by surprise.


Weapons
-------

 Demo has currently three different weapons, 9mm automatic pistol, pump action
shotgun and an assault rifle.

 Weapons have different characteristics - Each weapon has different effective
range, accuracy, damage and firing rate.


Stealth
-------

 You can use shadows to your advantage - More dark shadow you're in, less
probable it is that enemies can detect you.

 Too much noise will alert the enemies, so it's sometimes better avoid shooting.

 The faster you move, more noise you make.

 Be also aware that different materials have certain noise level - Footsteps
ring on metal quite loudly, while walking on sand is much more quiet.

 The closer you are behind enemy, more clearly they hear you.


Better Ways to Beat Enemies
---------------------------

 Harley can throw empty shells to distract enemies and then attack them when you
got a good sight.

 If you approach enemy behind, unheard, you can knock him out without making too
much noise. Keep in mind that some enemies are more wide awake than others.

 There are quite a few dynamic elements in the demo level that you can exploit
to beat the enemies more easily - Look for welding gas bottles, fire
extinguishers, wooden crates and a few other items. These items that contain
explosive materials might explode after a few shots, taking down enemies nearby.


Technical Features Shown in Dead Justice Demo
---------------------------------------------

Graphical Features
------------------

- DirectX9 support, with support for HLSL and latest graphical effects.

- Different materials are simulated with pixel shaders:
  - Cubic environment reflections.
  - Skin shading with skydome illumination.
  - Metals with fresnel reflection for added realism.
  - Normal, specular and bump mapping used on various items to add more detail
    to medium/high resolution meshes. Weapons and parts motorcycle of use this
    method.

- Normal, specular and bump mapping in characters, more details are created with
  normal maps.

- Characters are dynamically light sourced, and normal maps lit accordingly.

- Characters also take environment illumination level in account, so characters
  are more dark in shadows and so on.

- Characters cast volumetric stencil buffer shadows properly on environment
  objects.

- Volumetric shadows are also light sourced, this can be seen well inside the
  storage building.


Scripting
---------

- Scriptable Particle systems - All particle systems in demo are scripted.

- Scriptable cut scenes - Intro and cutscene sequences are completely scripted,
  artist controlled effects, audio and animation.

- Scriptable enemy behaviour - Enemy AI combat, movement and other behavior is
  built mainly with scripting.


Sound Features
--------------

- 3D Audio.

- Material modeling (see next chapter).


Material modeling
-----------------

- Material modeling takes in account both audio and also how enemies react to
  you - In addition to having different audio reaction when shot / walked on,
  materials also cause noise in game world according to material definitions.

- All surface materials can have different material properties - Metallic
  materials clank and ring when you walk on them, sand grumbles under your
  boots and so on.

- Some materials can be shot through, so bullets won't stop to chainlink fences
  etc.

- Materials have different particle effect / audio reactions - Shooting metal
  throws sparks, stone chips fly when you shoot concrete, wood pieces fall
  when you shoot wooden fences.
