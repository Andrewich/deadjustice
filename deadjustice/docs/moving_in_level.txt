Moving In Level
---------------

- Objects from all affected cells must be collected first before checking collisions


Algorithm
---------

...
// Implemented in derived classes
obj->moveTo( delta, collisionInfo )
...

moveTo( delta, collisionInfo )
  collisionInfo.reset()
  collisionList.clear()
  moveToRecurse( delta, this->cell(), collisionInfo, collisionList )

  sort collisionList

  for each object in collisionList
    if this collides object
      cut delta if solid
      update collisionInfo

  update current cell and transform by collisionInfo
end

moveToRecurse( delta, cell, collisionInfo, collisionList )
  if this collides cell->bsp()
    cut delta (cell geometry is always solid)
    update collisionInfo
  
  for each object in cell
    if this collides object
      add object and collision distance to collisionList

  for each portal intersecting (cut) delta
    moveToRecurse( delta, portal->targetCell(), collisionInfo, collisionList )
end

Known Issues
------------

- Doesn't handle correctly the case if object is in other room but volume isn't
  (fat character just around the corner etc.)
