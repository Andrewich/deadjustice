Fight Sequences
---------------

To create an empty sequence, call level:createFightSequence() which returns a new sequence object. 
Call it's functions to set behavior. All functions except setEndBehavior have "start" & "end" parameters.


Functions
---------

-- Wait, stand where you are
--  No parameters

sequence:addWait( start, end )

-- Shoot/stop shooting at current target if target visible
--  state = true / false

sequence:addShoot( start, end, state )

-- Shoot once at current target if target visible

sequence:addShootOnce( start, end )

-- Shoot at current target for n secs if target visible
--  duration = how long to keep shooting

sequence:addShootAuto( start, end, duration )	

-- Shoot blindly even if target not visible
--  duration = how long to keep shooting

sequence:addShootBlind( start, end, duration )

-- Crouch or uncrouch
--  state = true = crouch or false = uncrouch ( true = not nil or false = nil )

sequence:addCrouch( start, end, state )

-- Move to offset, keep moving until destination reached or new destination set
--  x, y, z = relative position in world space

sequence:addMove( start, end, x, y, z )

-- Move to absolute position, keep moving until destination reached or new destination set
--  x, y, z = world space position

sequence:addMoveAbsolute( start, end, x, y, z )

-- Move to absolute position if hero not close, keep moving until destination reached or hero too close or new destination set
--  x, y, z = world space position	
--  heroCloseThreshold = distance whence hero is too close

sequence:addMoveAbsolute( start, end, x, y, z, heroCloseThreshold )

-- Move closer to current target
--  amount = distance to move
--  limit = minimum distance to keep to target

sequence:addMoveCloser( start, end, amount, limit )

-- Move further from current target
--  amount = distance to move
--  limit = maximum distance to  target

sequence:addMoveFurther( start, end, amount, limit )

-- Evade a randomized distance left or right
--  amount = maximum distance

sequence:addEvade( start, end, amount )

-- Turn to face enemy

sequence:addFaceEnemy( start, end )

-- Turn to direction of movement

sequence:addTurnToMove( start, end )
