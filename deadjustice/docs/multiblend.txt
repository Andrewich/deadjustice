Multi animation blend notes
---------------------------

- Animations have different blend delays
- Animations run at different speeds
- MovementAnimation is capable of synchronizing playback
- GameCharacter's current two-animation blend is obsolete

Results
-------

- Create "Blender" with "AddBlend", "UpdateWeight", "FreeBlends" & "GetResult" methods.
  * Movement Animation calls "AddBlend" & "UpdateWeight"
  * GameCharacter calls "AddBlend" & "FreeBlends", GameCharacter::ApplyAnimations() calls "GetResult" 
- Blender does blend delays, weight normalizing, continuous animations with varying weight & fade outs on "FreeBlends"
