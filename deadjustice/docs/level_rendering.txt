Level Rendering
---------------

- All objects are rendering in one combined scene

- GameObjects return renderable object from getRenderObject if they have any


Algorithm
---------

gameCamera.render()
  normalizedViewport = (-1,-1,1,1)
  collectRenderObjectsFromCells( gameCamera, gameCamera->cell(), emptyScene, normalizedViewport )
  gameCamera->sceneCamera->render();
end

collectRenderObjectsFromCells( gameCamera, cell, scene, viewport )
  add cell->getRenderObject() to scene

  for each object in cell
    add object->getRenderObject() to scene
 
  for each portal in cell
    if portal in front of gameCamera front plane
      projectedPortal = portal projection to normalized screen space
      portalScreenRect = bounding rectangle of projectedPortal
      newViewport = intersectRectangles2D( viewport, portalScreenRect )
      if newViewport not empty
        collectRenderObjectsFromCells( gameCamera, portal->targetCell(), scene, newViewport )
end


Known Issues
------------

- Doesn't handle correctly the case if object is visible but the cell is not
  (explosion just around the corner etc.)
