(- Render To Texture -> General Settings -> Clear Unwrappers, Clear Shell Materials)

- Before modelling or after baking (=render to texture), change the system units to Metric -> 1 meter 
  and check (measure) your geometry scale, as .sg export handles incoming units as meters! 
  The Radiosity calculation seems to work only when metric units are in use.

- If you want to compress light maps in export, place "nvdxt.exe" in PATH of the system.

- Setting up extended material parameters :
  Open Customize -> Preferences -> Advanced Lightning
  Material Editor -> Display Reflectance & Transmittance Information -> on

- On first time when run : 
  Select one object
  Render To Texture -> Selected Object Settings
  Add one lighting map
  Set filename -> change to .tga and disable RLE compression before saving.
  ( You must do this, since the compression tool fails to load 3dsmax generated .jpg files! )
  Remove the lighting map

- Select All Objects

- Advanced Lighting -> Reset All
  Initial quality -> 98% or more 

- Advanced Lighting -> Start
  When solution quality reaches initial quality is reached, 
  set Refine iterations for all objects to 10-50 iterations and press Start again.
  Refining the solution lessens radiosity noise by repositioning vertices, 
  but after refining the solution, lighting calculation cannot be continued any more!

- Always do your texture baking fresh from the previous stage, if you rebake an already baked
  scene, the lightmaps will lose contrast!

- Render To Textures -> General Settings:
  Create Baked Materials -> StdMtl.SaveAll
  File Output Path -> ...
  Nearest Power of 2 on

- Render To Textures -> Selected Object Settings -> LightingMap -> Selected Element Unique Settings
  Shadows on/off
  Direct Light on/off
  Indirect Light on
