Portalization in Level Editing


General
-------

Cells and portals are identified by tags used in object names.

Used tags:
CELL
PORTAL


Cells
-----

Cells are created by creating objects with tag CELL in their name.
Tag is case sensitive. 
Objects belong to the cell if they are parented to the cell object.
Cell objects can be either dummy objects or geometry.


Portals
-------

Portals are thin, planar-like scaled dummy objects.
Movement from one cell to another can only 
be done by passing through a portal between two cells. 
Portals are identified by PORTAL tag and two cell names.
See below for examples.

Portals must never intersect or overlap each other.
The actual portal plane is placed in the middle of
the X-axis dimension of the dummy box so the box
must be 'thin' in direction of local space X-axis.
Local space X axis must point to the first cell in 
the name tag, i.e. if portal name is PORTAL:CELL1-CELL2,
then portal dummy local X-axis must point to CELL1 side.


Examples
--------

Cell names:
first CELL
boiler room CELL
ware room CELL

Portal names:
PORTAL:first CELL-second CELL
PORTAL:boiler room CELL-ware room CELL
