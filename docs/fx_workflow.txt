In 3dsmax
---------

1) Set tag to material name FX=<filename without .fx extension>,
   for example 'My Material FX=bump'
   to use bump.fx shader effect
2) Export scene normally


Viewing
-------

1) Copy used .fx files to the scene export output directory
2) Open scene in sgviewer
   (note: sgviewer must be started first)


Effect Parameters
-----------------

- Only Standard Material texture channels are exported:
  - tDiffuse
  - tReflection
  - tBump
  - tLightMap
  
- Object world space direction/position can be used in effect 
  file by referring to object name with 'd' or 'p' prefix,
  e.g. dLight1 is direction of Light1 and
  pLight2 is position of Light2

- Special parameters: 
  - mWorld = model->world transform
  - mTotal = model->world->view->proj transform
  - pCamera = camera position in world


Vertex Formats
--------------

Vertex format of exported geometry needs to be
known exactly when writing the vertex shader.
This is limitation of DX8 shader and effect files.
Following logic defines the exported vertex format:

- Vertex position (3 floats) is exported always

- Vertex normal (3 floats) is exported if 
  geometry does not use vertex color

- Diffuse color (4 bytes) is exported if
  geometry uses vertex color

- Texture coordinate layer 0 (2 floats) is exported 
  if Diffuse texture is used

- Texture coordinate layer 1 (2 floats) is exported
  if Self Illumination texture (lightmap) is used
  
- Vertex tangent space U (3 floats) is exported
  if material if Bump texture is used


About Shader Debugging
----------------------

- See debug output for unresolved shader parameters

- Use DirectX Debug DLLs for shader debug information
